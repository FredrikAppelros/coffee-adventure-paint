# Paint

This is to be a laboration for an introductory programming course. It has yet to be deconstructed and divided into exercises.

All exercises will be using [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Less](http://lesscss.org/).

## Installation

First of all, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) needs to be installed. Using npm, install both [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) globally:

```
npm install -g gulp bower
```

Now the local packages needs to be installed; run the following:

```
npm install && bower install
```

## Usage

Now that the development environment is installed, using it is as simple as running gulp:

```
gulp
```

Gulp will now watch for changes to your files and automatically compile and minify your code and update your browser for you.
